# olearn
The AI  and visualization tool for boosting the capabilities of offline learning with kolibri.
Note: Currently this project is made to run as a django project locally, but it could also be containerized and ran elsewhere.
Documentation: Comments are on their way...
Installation:
You will need to replace the kolibri_db_loc in settings.py with the one found in kolibri under device>info>advanced>database. Note: Further work is being done to ensure scalability accross multiple devices for providing this setting
